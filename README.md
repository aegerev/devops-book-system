**NOTE: I will be updating this repository as time goes on. Bear with me!**

## About this project
This project is a basic web-based API for managing a small book inventory. It will use a 2-tier architecture (Postgres database and a Django application), Docker Compose for managing the tiers, GitHub for version control, and cloud deployment. Interaction with the API will primarily be through Insomnia.
Functionality:

The API will provide the following basic functionalities:
1. Adding a new book: Allows adding a book to the inventory with details like title, author, ISBN, publication year, and quantity.
2. Retrieving book details: Enables fetching details of a specific book based on its ID or ISBN.
3. Listing all books: Provides an endpoint to retrieve a list of all books currently in the inventory.
4. Updating book information: Allows modifying the details (e.g., quantity, publication year) of an existing book.
5. Deleting a book: Enables removing a book from the inventory.
